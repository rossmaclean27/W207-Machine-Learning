    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "a) KNN perform poorly in this context because it is being applied to a sparse matrix with high dimensionality data.  In this dataset there are a total of 26,879 words in the dataset which means the features vectors have a length of 26,879, comprised mostly of zeros because most words won't appear in each of these short text excerpts.  This results in feature vectors that are very similar to one another.  This causes complications for the nearest neighbors classifier because each feature vector is a remarkably similar distance away from the sample being classified, increasing the likelihood of misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Naive Bayes and logistic regression differ from each other in a few notable ways. Naive Bayes assumes conditional independence between each of the features vectors weights and so if there is a high-degree of correlation between certain words a a given label this model would be prone to bias.  Logistic regression is however less prone to such biases because the coefficient weights accounts for the correlation between input features.  In the case of our bag-of-words example it's likely that certain words are good predictors of a particular news category are also correlated.  As Naive Bayes outperforms logistic regression (0.780 vs. 0.705) then it's quite likely that the dataset follows this bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional distinction is that Naive Bayes is a generative classifier that learns the joint probabilities of the inputs and labels, and then makes predictions using the calculated posteriors, P(y|x).  Logistic regression is a discrimative classifier that estimates the probability of P(y|x) directly from the data.  My research also suggests that generative models tend to perform better with less training data compared to discrimative models but we have 2,034 training samples so this point may be mute.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The logistic regression model used applies 'L2 Regularization' to mitigate against overfitting.  In the case of ridge regression, the penalty term added is the sum of the squared magnitude of the coefficients.  A smaller C value represents stronger regularization, and as such results in smaller coefficients weights because the relationship between the predictors and response variables is more conservative.  This explains is why the sum of squared coefficients increases as the value of C increases."

    "**(6)** The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001).\n",

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauging by the outputted text for the first two documents with the highest r ratio, it seems like the presence of certain technical words is causing the logistic regression model to misclassify these examples as comp.graphics.  Words such as ftp, rich text format, ASCII, internet and online presumably all have large positive weights associated with the comp.graphics label across the entire corpus of text within train_data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third document should have been classified as alt.atheism but in fact was misclassified as talk.religion.misc.  It's a little different than the other two documents because intuitively it seems like none of the words appear to be better indicators of talk.religion.misc compared to alt.atheism.  One possible explanation is that 'ambiguous' words such as eight, two and children (for example) may have larger weights associated with the talk.religion.misc category simply because they happen to appear in more of the training examples for that label, resulting in misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible solution is to prune those features which do not have a particularly strong weight associated with a single label, i.e. those words that are not good indicators of a certain category.  Additionally, features prime for pruning could be defined as those which are good indicators of a particular category but that also appear frequently in other categories, resulting in misclassification more often (as obeserved in the two documents with the high error ratios).  Removal of such words would reduce the likelihood of a document being misclassified while allowing other features that are good predictors of a given label to take effect.\n"
